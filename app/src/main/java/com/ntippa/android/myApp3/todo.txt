The zip file has to folders-
p3-1- Alexandria app
P3-2-Football scores app.

For P3-1 Alexandria app-
## I handled few error cases. to highlight them, i have added comments like this : //todo:
cases are
-Check Network availability
-Check if the scanned barcode is ISBN barcode.
-No Book data


## I am assuming that Google play services are installed on devices that are testing this app functionality.
I do have GoogleClientAPi code in place but doesnt seem to work as expected. Yet to fix that.

##I am using Mobile Vision API for scanning barcodes. This scanning functionality expects that the barcode to be scanned in proper light setting.
I dont have falshlight or autoFocus functionality. Hence this dependency.


For Football scores app-P3-2,
I have implemented a collection widget.( List view of Football matches).
